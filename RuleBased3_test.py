ut.RuleBased3();

'''
In this function we rely on the function Rulebased to give us
A threshold value for the pitch which we then use in order to compare, and seperate the vocals,
we were hoping to take a step towards building a system with more automony

    
AveragePitchA   289.9488450698882
AverageFormantsA 3525.908904079055
AveragePitchB   345.2865727808881
AverageFormantsB 3609.269423032891
Number A guesses  11
Number B guesses  19
the rule based system has made  26  right guesses and  4  wrong ones.
Thus accuracy is  86.66666666666667 %
