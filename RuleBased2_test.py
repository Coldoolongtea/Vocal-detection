import utils as ut

ut.RuleBased2();

'''
This fucntion is similar to the RuleBased function with a slight change in
the way we sort the data, we notice that the first function is more accurate than this one

An example of the output :
    
   
AveragePitchA   287.36086781095986
AverageFormantsA 3536.5204693594646
AveragePitchB   341.0167410834641
AverageFormantsB 3631.5272294187675
Number A guesses  12
Number B guesses  18
the rule based system has made  25  right guesses and  5  wrong ones.
Thus accuracy is  83.33333333333333 %
