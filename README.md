"# Vocal-detection" 

This project's goal is to build a rule based system allowing for speaker voice classification.  Different functions were created and applyed to vocal recordings of people will allowing us to study features that are meaningful when it comes to recognising the speaker.
Furthermore, several elements in the treatment of the voice in a general way were be approached during this project.For example,the signal's energy, the fundamental frequency (F0), the Mel-Frequency, Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC), the Formant frequencies, etc.
All of this will be done with the help of python.
